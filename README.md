# Clock 
CS 210 Project 1 C++ 12/24 hour clock

This project was project 1 of cs210.  It was to make an application that the user could update the current time.  It would change the time on a 12 and 24 hour clock.
I believe overall everything worked as intended.  It could go a level deeper by actually getting the current date/time and adjusting that.  I have not fully tested the clock and the edge cases as well.
I need to come up with a better way of converting the time between 12 and 24 hour.  Currently it uses a long complicated if/else-if/else structure.
I liked the how the current implementation was flawless on the screen when updating the time.  There was no gaps or problems with the images on the screen.
I tried to keep everything commented for simplicity sake for the reader and I believe I could use this to create an even better application if I wanted to spend more time on this honing my skills.

Thanks,
